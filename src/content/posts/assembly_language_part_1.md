Imagine you have to go on a date with an alien. What do you need? What's the first thing you'd consider? Communication, right?  You need to know their language, right? You need to communicate in a way she can understand, you don't want to say something she doesn't understand, or worse, something she misunderstands. When you need to communicate with someone, you need to know their language. Similarly, with electronic machines, communication happens through electric signals or a flow of electrons.

In the early days, programmers communicated with computers by altering sequences of high and low voltage signals, like 0101001010 (0 for low voltage and 1 for high or some might consider opposite). Even today, electrical engineers grapple with this method when designing circuits or processors, as every they need to make an interface between hardware and software that is nice to software engineers. Writing even a simple program could take days, contingent on the hardware architecture. To ease this burden, they devised a system where specific instructions, represented by sequences of high and low voltages (0s and 1s), were assigned mnemonic codes, streamlining the process those are called assembly instructions ,

Assembly instructions could be anything one can think of; you can even create them , by making your own assembler that maps your mnemonic to machine code.
